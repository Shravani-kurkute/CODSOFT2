Machine Learning Tasks Submission

- Task 1
  MOVIE GENRE
CLASSIFICATION

Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers

such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector

Machines.

- Task 2
SPAM SMS DETECTION

Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector

Machines to identify spam messages

- Task 3
CREDIT CARD FRAUD
DETECTION

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,

or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or

legitimate.
